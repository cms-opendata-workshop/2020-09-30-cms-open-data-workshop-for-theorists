 In 2014, CMS released a significant amount of data through the CERN Open Data Portal, available to anyone to analyze as they saw fit. In 2017, a theory group at MIT published two peer-reviewed publications using this data, prompting renewed discussion as to how to make these open datasets easier to work with by non-CMS analysts. The goal of this workshop is to lower the threshold for access to these data for theorists and phenomenologists. Attendees will be lead through the steps of how to login to the CERN virtual machines, run the CMS analysis software, and perform the basics of an analysis. All exercises will be hands-on and participants should be prepared to dive into the data right away. Time will also be spent brainstorming with attendees about how the entire process of accessing and analyzing the data could be made more useful for the broader HEP community.
